# SimRa-Visuals
* bike data analysis and visualisation from the [SimRa project](https://www.digital-future.berlin/forschung/projekte/simra/)
* the results are shown at www.extroversiv.de
* thanks go to the wonderful [osmnx](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx) and the [simra-dataset](https://github.com/simra-project/dataset)


### Current state
* this is very alpha
* if you want to contribute, there is the mapping of the gps coordinates to the openstreetmap edges which needs improvement: in SimRaVisuals.py find_nearest_edges() and analyze_ride_freq().
Problems occur especially at intersections. So we'd need to help the tracking stay on the obvious route.
